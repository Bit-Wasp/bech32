## bech32

This package provides a pure implementation of bech32 and
native segregated witness address encoding.

It will eventually replace the implementation in `bitwasp/bitcoin`
but as yet its primary purpose is serving old codebases which
have yet to upgrade.

Presently supports PHP version 5.6, 7.0-7.2 though
future releases will deprecate 5.6 support.

### Install

    composer require bitwasp/bech32
